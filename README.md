# 💫 About Me:
I’m a Software Engineer, passionate about building scalable, high-performance applications that solve real-world problems. My expertise spans both the Java ecosystem (Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate) and modern JavaScript frameworks (React, Node.js, TypeScript), giving me the versatility to deliver robust solutions across the full stack.<br>I specialize in designing and implementing RESTful APIs, microservices, and cloud-native architectures on AWS, with a strong foundation in low-level design (LLD) and high-level design (HLD) principles. This allows me to architect systems that are not only efficient but also maintainable and future ready.<br>Currently, I’m advancing my knowledge through a master’s in computer science at Woolf University and the Scaler Academy Software Engineering program, where I focus on algorithms, distributed systems, and system design.<br>Highlights of my work include:<br>- 🚀 Improving latency by 80% by rewriting the backend structures efficiently.<br>- 💡 Reducing operational costs by 35% by implementing in house routing solution for drivers. <br>- 🤝 Mentoring junior developers to uphold clean, maintainable code practices<br>Beyond engineering, I’m deeply curious about financial markets, applying analytical skills to trading and market research. I also enjoy playing guitar, which keeps my creativity alive and fuels fresh perspectives in problem-solving.<br>🔑 Core Skills: Java · Spring Boot · Hibernate · Full-Stack Development · Cloud Architecture (AWS) · React · Node.js · TypeScript · SQL/PostgreSQL/MySQL · LLD/HLD · Agile/Scrum · System Design
